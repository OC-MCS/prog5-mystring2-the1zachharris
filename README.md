default constructor shouldn't allocate memory  
You're not using the standard library string functions...you're writing your own loops. This would confuse everybody that looked at the code  
they would waste time tracing your code trying to figure out why you didn't just call strcpy, strcat, and strcmp. Do standard things using standard tools.  
operator= needs to check for self-assignment
